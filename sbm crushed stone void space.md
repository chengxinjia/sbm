Voids,settlement and weight of crushed stone IDEALS Illinois Crushed stone has become an important material of construc tion in modern engineering work.The chief causes for this are the great increase in the use of. How to Calculate the Volume of Voids Sciencing A void is the volume of space in a material such as sand or gravel not occupied by particles.The volume of voids is made up of tiny gaps between particles of the material.Calculating the volume of voids can be complex,requiring hightech tools such as measuring lasers. Porosity and Bulk Density of Sedimentary Rocks USGS. Total porosity is a measure of all the void space of porous material.It includes.stones,and the total porosity as determined by the grain density bulk density. crushed stone voids Earthwork grading engineering Eng 200379&ensp&#0183&enspIt depends upon the specific gravity of the stone as well as the gradation.I use a dry rodded unit weight of 1630 kg m3 and a specific gravity of 2.68 for the gravels in my loion.That would equate to a void ratio of about 0.62 ignoring the pores on the face of the aggregate particles.
