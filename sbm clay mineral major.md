Late Precambrian Oxygenation; Inception of the Clay. An enigmatic stepwise increase in oxygen in the late Precambrian is widely considered a prerequisite for the expansion of animal life.Accumulation of oxygen requires organic matter burial in sediments,which is largely controlled by the sheltering or preservational effects of detrital clay minerals in modern marine continental margin depocenters. INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS OF BENTONITE by 2009 3 23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Depending upon the relative proportions of clay and water,these mixtures are used as bonding,plasticizing,and suspending agents.Bentonites disperse into colloidal particles and,accordingly,provide large surface areas per unit weight of clay.This large surface area is a major … Question: What Are The Three Major Groups Of Clay Minerals, The occurrence of clay minerals in soils is due to one of the following three major processes: inheritance,transformation or neoformation Which is a use for clay?
