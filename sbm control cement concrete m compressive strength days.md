Concrete Compressive Strength an overview. Concrete compressive strength does not depend on the full hydration of its cement particles but essentially on their closeness.10,11 In a concrete having a water cement ratio lower than 0.42,hydration stops when there is no more water to hydrate the cement particles.Below this critical value of 0.42,very fine cement particles can be fully hydrated but only the surface of the coarsest ones.
