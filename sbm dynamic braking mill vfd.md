Some VFD's require external braking resistors for fast stops,the one on my mill apparently does,as it won't decel the motor at all if it's spinning fast.ANY 3 phase motor is reversable by simply reversing the 2 of the 3 leads,but that's done by the VFD if you're driving the motor with one. What Are Braking Resistors? — ES Components A Franchised. How does a dynamic braking resistor work? Dynamic braking is the use of the electric traction motors of a railroad vehicle as generators when slowing the locomotive.It is termed rheostatic if the generated electrical power is dissipated as heat in brake grid resistors,and regenerative if the power is returned to the supply line.
