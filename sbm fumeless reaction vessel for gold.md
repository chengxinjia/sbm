sbm fumeless reaction vessel for goldEpner Technology,precious metals plating including, Our inspector inside of a 3 meter high chemical reaction vessel,Some of the earliest patents for plating on plastics were owned by Epner Technology They were for gold plating plastic military buttons and insignia during World War II,saving millions of pounds of brass being use for shell casings,the performance of the vessels gave us. Why Does Gold Turn Your Skin Black? Healthfully Why Does Gold Turn Your Skin Black?.Gold is a soft,inert,elementary metal.This means it rarely reacts with other elements or living tissue.However,it can still happen.Gold used for jewelry is not pure.Pure gold is so soft that one could mold it like clay in one's hands.As a result,base metals are often mixed with gold when it is used for jewelry in order to harden it.
