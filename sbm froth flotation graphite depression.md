Froth Flotation Graphite Depression greenrevolution.org.in Froth flotation is commonly used for the concentration of low grade graphite ore.Effect of depressant on graphite flotation Various types of depressants such as gum arabic,quebracho,gelatin,tannic acid,sodium silicate were used in a few preliminary flotation tests. What is the role of depressant in froth floatation process? Feb 19,2019 · What is the role of depressant in froth floatation process? Answer.In the froth floatation process,the role of the depressants is to separate two sulphide ores by selectively preventing one ore from forming froth.For example,to separate two sulphide ores (ZnS and Pbs),NaCN is used as a depressant which selectively allows PbS to come with. low power consumption mix type flotation machines for.  · Floatability study of graphite ore from southeast AIP Publishing.types,fixed carbon content and liberation size of the graphite.graphite by froth flotation was studied by investigating the effect of reagents concentrations,In commercial plants,the control of reagent addision becomes the most such as mineralogy of the graphite ore,the.
