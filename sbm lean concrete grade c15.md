sbm lean concrete grade c15Concrete Mix Design M 20 Grade Of Concrete M25 = Compressive strength of a 150 mm cube of this concrete after 28 days will have a strength of 25 Newton mm2.How different grade of concrete is made is just not the issue of what amount of cement is to be used but what type of cement,aggregate &amp; sand is being used also effects the stregth and thereby the grade. Different Grades of Concrete,Their Strength and Selection. What is Grade of Concrete? Grade of concrete is defined as the minimum strength the concrete must posses after 28 days of construction with proper quality control.Grade of concrete is denoted by prefixing M to the desired strength in MPa.For example,for a grade of concrete with 20 MPa strength,it will be denoted by M20,where M stands for Mix. Lean Concrete Grade C15 Lean Concrete Grade C15.Controlled lowstrength material clsm,or lean concrete subbase.generally cement treated and lean concrete subbases are 4 to 6 inches thick.a modulus of subgrade reaction of 400 to 500 psiinch can be used in calculating the required thickness of floors placed directly on lean concrete and cement treated or roller.

Lean Mix Concrete Specification Use Of Lean Concrete Lean concrete contains a lower level of cement in it,that is why it's mainly used for fillings or under the foundations,to keep it safe from the soil.5.Lean concrete is applied to arrange a level surface,where main foundation (raft,isolated or any other type) can be set.6.Another objective is to safeguard main foundation from soil. Calculate Cement Sand &amp Aggregate M20,M15,M10,M5 The strength of the concrete greatly depends on the density of the concrete hence we should not play with the ratio of sand to aggregate.I would suggest the ratio of 1:2:3 or 1:1.5:3 for M20 grade concrete and 1:2:4 or 1:2.5:3.5 for M15 grade concrete.If you prepare concrete with your ration then the concrete will have too much sand.
