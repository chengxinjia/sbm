Micronutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease Apr 27,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32Patients with IBD,especially those with CD,are at a risk for a variety of nutritional deficiencies because of reduced nutrient intake or absorption,or increased nutrient losses.1 Nutritional deficiencies in IBD patients can be divided into those involving macronutrients (nutrients needed in large amounts) and those involving micronutrients (nutrients required in small quantities).2 In Four mineral nutrients required in large quantities by … A).It does not affect women B).It generally affects the brain C).AIDS virus can vary its genetic code outwitting a vaccine D).all those infected by a blood transfusion get AIDS Minerals and trace elements British Nutrition Foundation Others are required in smaller quantities and are sometimes called trace minerals,e.g.iron,zinc,iodine,fluoride,selenium and copper.Despite being required in smaller amounts,trace minerals are no less important than other minerals.Minerals are often absorbed more efficiently by the body if supplied in foods rather than as supplements. Minerals are essential nutrients for the human body. Minerals can be divided into two main egories,based on the amount that is needed by the body.1.Macrominerals.They are present in relatively large amounts in the body and are required in fairly large amounts in the diet —more than 100 milligrams daily.
