sbm coal mill level controlDust explosion Mining of coal leads to coal dust,and flour mills likewise have large amounts of flour dust as a result of milling.A gigantic explosion of flour dust destroyed a mill in Minnesota on May 2,1878,killing 14 workers at the Washburn A Mill and another four in adjacent buildings. Coal plants installed mercury controls to meet compliance. Of the coal capacity installing pollution control equipment to comply with MATS,activated carbon injection (ACI) was the dominant compliance strategy,with close to 78 GWs of coal capacity adding ACI.Activated carbon injection systems work by injecting powdered activated carbon into the flue stack (exhaust) of a coal fired power plant.
