sbm crusher short versus long axis of the rotary axisEverything you need to know about 5 axis machining What is 5 Axis? When someone uses the term “5 axis” they are typically referring to the ability of a CNC machine to move a part or a tool on five different axes at the same time.3 axis machining centers move a part in two directions (X and Y),and the tool moves up and down (Z).5 Axis machining centers can rotate on two additional rotary axes (A and B) which help the cutting tool. This document is a summary of Rotating Machinery Rotor.
