Different Types of Iron Ore 7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Hematite is sometimes found in vein like deposits which are not usually large enough to be important.Such ore bodies have been found near Kitchener,B.C.and in the Matachewan area,Ontario.Deposits of considerable size have been found at the contacts of igneous intrusions,generally basic,with crystalline limestone,dolomite,and limey shale; the ore is usually of the specular variety,and.The first process that most of the ores or minerals undergo after they leave any mine,is mineral processing or mineral ore dressing.It is a process of ore preparation,milling,and ore dressing. Mineral Exploration Future ore bodies will probably be more costly to find,mine,and process than those in operation and production now,because most of them will either be of lower grade or found at greater depths.The chances of a mineral occurrence being developed as a mine are low (may be 1 in 1000).22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;mining companies extract resources from mineral deposits around the globe and use different techniques to recover the valuable mineral resources from the ore.The choice of a suitable technique,which is both environmentally sound and economically viable,to process mineral resources very much depends on the type of ore which is mined as .Screening for Metal Accumulators from Mineral Ore Rich.
