The transition rules for the new DFA can be directly calculated then.For example if you are in state Ab,and you get a 0 on input,the first DFA would go to state B and the second one to state b,so the union DFA's next state for this input will be Bb.This method works in every case when you need to make a union of two or more DFAs.
