How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? Reference Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining.The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore. How iron is made material,manufacture,making,history. Evidence of what is believed to be the first example of iron mining and smelting points to the ancient Hittite culture in what is now Turkey.Because iron was a far superior material for the manufacture of weapons and tools than any other known metal,its production was a closely guarded secret.washing with water to float sand and clay. How is Steel Produced? World Coal Association Iron ore is produced in around 30 countries in 2017,the largest producers were Australia,Brazil and China.Around 98% of iron ore is used in steel making.During the iron making process,a blast furnace is fed with the iron ore,coke and small quantities of fluxes (minerals,such as limestone,which are used to collect impurities). Sand and Gravel Mining Industry Additional Information.
