Grinding Aids for Ball Mills Industrial Efficiency. A ball mill generally loses its grinding efficiency remarkably at fine grinding.This is because fine particles from ground materials agglomerate and adhere to the mill liners or grinding media as coating,reducing the impulsive force of the mill.In addition,the agglomerated particles are mixed into the coarse powder in the separator and recirculated through the mill.
