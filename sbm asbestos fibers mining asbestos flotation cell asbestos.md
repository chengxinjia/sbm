Asbestos FACILITIES MANAGEMENT Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral.It differs from other minerals in its crystal development.The crystal formation of asbestos is in the form of long thin fibers.Asbestos is divided into two mineral groups Serpentine and Amphibole.The division between the two types of asbestos is based upon the crystalline structure. Asbestos Removal: Harmful Effects Of Asbestos Exposure Asbestos is the term used when describing a specific group of minerals containing magnesium silicate fibers.Coined as "the magic mineral," it possesses a natural fire resistant property making it ideal for flooring,roofing,and thermal insulation.However,the advantages of asbestos usage come with the dangers of being exposed to this material. Asbestos Exposure During Uncontrolled Removal of Sprayed. Some interesting information is also provided in this study about the time required to form asbestos bodies.The iron rich coating deposited on fibers indicates interaction with macrophages or giant cells in the lungs (Pooley,1972; Koerten et al.1990).At 18 months after exposure,the aspect of most coated fibers is atypical for asbestos bodies. Asbestos Exposure: an Overview Mesothelioma News Individual asbestos fibers can embed themselves in lung tissue and other areas of the respiratory system.This,in turn,can cause irritation and inflammation that can gradually result in the formation of tumors and cancerous cells.Asbestos and mesothelioma are often linked because the substance is the only known cause of the disease. Asbestos Mines The modern asbestos industrial age began in the 1870 s with the opening of large asbestos industries in Scotland,Germany and England for the production of asbestos boards.Active mining in Quebec (Canada) began in 1878 and by 1885 seven white asbestos mines close to the town of Thetford were active.In 1896 the first asbestos brake linings.
