Optimization of room and pillar dimensions using automated. Room and pillar (R&P) mining is a method of extracting a series of rooms (i.e.long horizontal openings) while leaving behind pillars of ore,rock,or coal.In hard rock masses,pillar widths are smaller than entry widths.Pillars can be constituted solely of ore or of ore and waste when the ore body is thin. Coal Mining Methods Coal Mining Methods Underground Mining Longwall & Room and Pillar Mining Longwall mining and room and pillar mining are the two basic methods of mining coal underground,with room and pillar being the traditional method in the United States.Both methods are well suited to extracting the relatively flat coalbeds (or coal seams) typical of coal mining Room and pillar mining Students. coal mining Room and pillar mining In this method,a number of parallel entries are driven into the coal seam.The entries are connected at intervals by wider entries,called rooms,that are cut through the seam at right angles to the entries.The resulting grid formation creates thick pillars of coal that support the overhead strata of earth and rock.There are two main room and pillar.
