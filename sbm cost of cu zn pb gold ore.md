Silver Lead Zinc Ore Processing Method using Flotation The ore contained sphalerite,a portion of which was easily floatable but difficult to depress in the lead flotation circuit.Also,the recovery of silver minerals occurring in a lead,zinc sulfide ore is efficiently accomplished using Flowsheet #2. Flotation experiment research on a polymetallic sulfide ore of sulfide ore in Shanxi province are copper,lead,zinc,gold,and silver.The grades of Cu,Pb,Zn,Au,and Ag are 0.49%,1.22%,1.95%,1.78 g t and 59.06 g t,respectively.Gold and silver canot be observed using a microscope because they are usually in the form of fine grains or super fine grain inclusions,which also occur in other metal Bioleaching of high grade Zn Pb bearing ore by mixed. In this research,the bioleaching mechanism of zinc and lead from high grade Zn Pb ore has been investigated.It is done by using mixed culture of iron and sulfur oxidizing moderate thermophilic.
