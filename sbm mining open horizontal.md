sbm mining open horizontalMining Mining Mining Horizontal openings: drifts: All horizontal or subhorizontal development openings made in a mine have the generic name of drift.These are simply tunnels made in the rock,with a size and shape depending on their use—for example,haulage,ventilation,or exploration.A drift running parallel to the ore body and lying in the footwall is called a footwall drift,and drifts. Digging deeper: Mining methods explained Anglo … Underground mining is practical when: The ore body is too deep to mine profitably by open pit.The grades or quality of the orebody are high enough to cover costs.Underground mining has a lower ground footprint than open pit mining.The underground mining methods we use include room and pillar,narrow vein stoping and large scale mechanised.
