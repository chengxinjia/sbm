Sulfide Ores an overview ScienceDirect Topics Copper sulfide ores must be concentrated before they can be economically transported and smelted.The universal technique for this concentration is froth flotation of finely ground ore.Froth flotation entails attaching fine Cu sulfide mineral particles to bubbles and floating them out of a water ore mixture. Copper Flotation 2020 2 24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A Copper Flotation Flowsheet.Because the copper in this type of ore usually assays only plus or minus 1% copper,the porphyry copper operations must be relatively large in order to be commercial.The flowsheet in this study illustrates a typical 3,000 ton per day operation.
